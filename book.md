# Elevator Pitch

# Tagline

# Outline
- Introduction (personal, establish credibility)
- Front-end is now a specialization
- What truly is “Modular CSS”?
- The “how” has been covered (naming conventions, organization, SRP, separation of concerns, etc.)
- Let’s answer “why,” what is the thought process? How do we decide when something is something?
- Examples, examples, examples (explore five sites breaking down patterns)

# 1. Introduction

## Who am I?
I'm Drew Barontini. 

## What do I do?
I'm a front-end developer for Code School.

## What is Code School?

Code School is an online platform for teaching web technologies. We have interactive courses teaching technologies like Ruby on Rails, Sass, Git, Angular, and iOS.

## What am I responsible for?
I maintain and lead the front-end for the .com, our course engine, and oversee buildout of individual courses.

## What about personal stuff?
When I'm not sitting at the computer, I like to exercise, watch TV and movies, play with my two yellow labs, Maddox and Tank, and spend time with friends and family. As you can most likely tell from my last name, I'm Italian. This means that my entire family has an opinion on everything, no matter the subject.

## How did I get here?
- Band
- MySpace
- T-shirts
- Computer science
- Front-end
- It’s a specialization
- CSS is easy to write, hard to write well

## My OCD
Last year, Nick Walsh, a fantastic front-end developer at Envy Labs, and myself put on a workshop at this conference. For that, Dan made cartoons of us. In order to understand how I am (my essence), I'll explain why I look like a janitor. Story time: I'm very OCD. I like things very clean and organized. For Christmas a few years ago, my Mom bought me a professional-grade back-pack vacuum to keep my house clean. I'll say that one more time: My Mom, for Christmas, bought me a professional-grade back-pack vacuum. I hope that slightly conveys my insanity.
